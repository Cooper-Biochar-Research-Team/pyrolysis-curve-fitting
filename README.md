# pyrolysis-curve-fitting.py
This python script can be used to read the csv file that contains the time-temperature data obtained from the tube furnace. It will generate the curve integration results, calculate the reaction time and the enthalpy of reaction. Several graphs will also be generatred, and the detailed list is shown below.
## Graphs Generated
Figure 1. The time-temperature curves of all entries </br>
Figure 2. The time-temperature curves of empty sets </br>
