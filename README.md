# pyrolysis-curve-fitting.py
This python script can be used to read the csv file that contains the time-temperature data obtained from the tube furnace. It will generate the curve integration results and several graphs
## Graphs
Figure 1. The time-temperature curves of all entries
Figure 2. The time-temperature curves of empty sets
Figure 3. The time-temperature curves of pyrolysis test sets
FIgure 4. Reaction times vs. temperature
